\begin{slide}[\slideopts,method=direct,toc={}]{Overview}

Sequence Models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), arose from a blend of principle-based design and empirical discovery, spanning several fields.
\maybepause
This talk describes how the ideas could have emerged from an elementary signal-processing approach.
\maybepause
This viewpoint offers some features:
\begin{enumerate}
\mpitem Signal processing folks can quickly learn what is happening in a motivated way
\mpitem Machine-learning experts might benefit from signal-processing insights
\mpitem Obvious suggestions for things to try next naturally arise
\end{enumerate}

\begin{slide}[\slideopts]{Intended Audience}

\maybepause
\textbf{Intended Audience:} Precursors to this talk were aimed at
\begin{enumerate}
\mpitem CCRMA students after one introductory signal-processing course
\mpitem West Coast Machine Learning meetup group: mostly in machine learning
\end{enumerate}
\maybepause
This version is aimed at
\begin{enumerate}
  \mpitem[3.] Signal-processing students and professionals,\\
              assumed to know more DSP than machine learning (like me)
\end{enumerate}
