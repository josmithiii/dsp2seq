\begin{slide}[\slideopts]{Overview}

\begin{itemize}

\mpitem Sequence Models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), arose
from a blend of principle-based design and empirical discovery,
spanning several fields.

\mpitem This talk describes how the ideas could have emerged from an
elementary signal-processing approach.

\mpitem This viewpoint offers some features:
\begin{enumerate}
\mpitem Signal processing folks can quickly learn what is happening in a motivated way
\mpitem Machine-learning experts might benefit from signal-processing insights
\mpitem Obvious suggestions for things to try next naturally arise
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
